# OpenStack Image for `cinder`

This is an automatically generated and synchronzied repository for the `cinder`
project images.  The repository is built using the `atmosphere-ci` tool that

If you need to make any changes, please propose them to that repository or else
they will be wiped out the next time the repository is synchronized.
